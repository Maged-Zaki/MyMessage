# Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/Maged-Zaki/MyMessage.git
```

```
cd MyMessage

```

```
python -m venv venv

```
**On Windows**
```
venv\Scripts\activate

```
```
pip install -r windows_requirements.txt

```
**On MacOS**
```
source venv/bin/activate

```
```
pip install -r macOs_requirements.txt
```

**At this moment before we run the server we need download the secret_client file from google console.**
1. After we create our google credentials, Download the secret_client file.
2. copy and paste the file into the root of the project.

**Now we need to create config.py file at the root of the project**
1. at the root of the project, create config.py
2. copy and paste the following then fill in the required configuration

```
# google client id from google_client_secret file
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = " 
CLIENT_SECRET_FILE_PATH = ""

# app secret
SECRET_KEY = "" 

# mail configuration
MAIL_USERNAME = ''
MAIL_PASSWORD = ''
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = ''

```

**Now we can start the server with the following command**

```
flask run
```

**Now the server is running**
Head to http://localhost:5000

**That's it, we are done, we can now create an account and start messaging people!**
